    * SECRET_KEY🔑🔒
    * EMAIL Options

* The databases should be set up by default but in case you have the same keys used here in your environment variables modify your databases section in intranetsite/settings.py accordingly.It will use sqlite.<br/>
* You can also configure the email section to point to your smtp provider.Default is localhost on port 8025.<br/>
* (if testing on localhost) For this to work, run the following command to start a dummy debugging server<br/>
